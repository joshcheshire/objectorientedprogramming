on a free standing function, 'this ' refers to the window

- On a function that is attached to an object(i.e a method) this refers to the host object

--In JS, functions are objects, so they can have their own methods.
		3 examples are Call, Apply and Bind

		Apply is a little better, but call is simpler, easier to write and read.
		Apply is more vesatile than call, anything call can do , apply can do but it doesnt go the other way

--CALL AND APPLY call the original fx, and return whatever the fx returns
--BIND returns a new fx with its 'this' context permanently bound

-- Math.max
